# The Third Library and the Commons

This repository contains the code to reproduce the word cloud in "The Third Library and the Commons" (Johnson, Johnston, and Ranganath 2021; additional citation information is forthcoming), which is part of the Council on Library and Information Resources [CLIR](https://www.clir.org) *Futures* project. The code is available as a rendered markdown file [here](file:///Users/adityaranganath/Documents/git_repositories/clirproject/strategic_plan_wordcloud.html), and a spreadsheet with links to the various strategic plans used to generate the corpus is available in the repository's [data](https://github.com/aranganath24/clirproject/tree/main/data) directory.
